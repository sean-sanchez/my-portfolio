          Hi, and welcome to my portfolio. I am a first generation Peruvian college student.
          I grew up on Long Island, NY and am currently attending college at Cornell University
          in Ithaca, NY.

      <p>
          Meet the family!
      </p>

          I somehow became the tallest in the family. My father is 5'5" and my mother is 5'0", 
          but I am 6'0". I think it's weird, but I am not complaining!!!
      </p>

          The family photo was taken in Peru, so these members of the family were not in able to be 
          in the photo.<br>Nonetheless, I would like to introduce you to my favorite part of the 
          family (don't tell my brother).
