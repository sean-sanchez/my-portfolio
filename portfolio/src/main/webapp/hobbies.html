    <h2>Sports</h2>

    <div class="hobby">
      <h4>Tennis</h4>
      <p>
        Tennis is easily defined as my favorite sport. I started playing with my father when I
        was around four years old. He would take my brother and I out to play even though we were
        not able to properly hit the ball over the net yet. Over the years, what used to be an 
        activity meant to bring us together as a family transitioned into an activity I am
        deeply passionate about.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined my first team and got my first coach as a freshman in high school. I joined
        varsity right away and played at that level for all four years. Throughout my high school
        career I earned many league awards and finished first or second in the league for three
        consecutive years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still love tennis to this day, and I will continue practicing to participate in local 
        tournaments.

      <h4>Soccer</h4>
      <p>
        Before I fell in love with tennis, I enjoyed soccer. Prior to entering high school, I had no
        friends that played tennis. So, I directed my energy towards soccer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I played for many years, with a brief period of inactivity due to health concerns, but I was
        never that good. I gradually started to enjoy soccer less and less, but I will always watch
        the FIFA World Cup. During the last tournament, Peru had finally qualified after 36 years of
        not making an appearance in the tournament. Vamos Per√∫!

      <h4>Basketball</h4>
      <p>
        It wasn't until my junior year of high school that I actually started to enjoy basketball.
        I wish I had shown interest in it earlier, but it wasn't until I saw friends of mine on
        the basketball team play that I was like, "WOW."
      </p>
      <p>
        Basketball is my favorite sport to watch and my favorite player is Luka Doncic. Even
        though Luka Doncic is my favorite player and I was raised in New York all my life, my
        favorite team is neither the Dallas Mavericks or a New York team (disappointing, I
        know). My favorite team is the Houston Rockets because James Harden made me a fan of
        the sport. The way he plays is just too fun to watch. Even though he still doesn't have
        a championship ring, I know he will get one before he retires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given all that I have said, my prediction for this year's
        champion is the Los Angeles Lakers. If the break due to quarantine hadn't occurred I
        believe the Los Angeles Clippers were going to win, but now that Lebron James is well
        rested I know he will carry his team to another ring.
      </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    
    <div class = "hobby">
      <h4>What I Listen To</h4>
      <p>
        I am always open to listen to any new genres of music, any new artists or any new 
        instruments. The most important thing for me to like a song or sound is that I
        need to be able to feel the emotion that the artist puts into it. Without emotion,
        music is just a bunch of nonsensical sounds to me. The emotion is what makes it an
        art and is the reason why not everyone can be an artist (completely my own opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
        With that being said, here is a list of my favorite artists/bands:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Michael Jackson
          <li>Mac Miller
          <li>Key!
          <li>Trippie Redd
          <li>Kodak Black
          <li>Maroon 5
          <li>Queen
          <li>Kid Cudi
          <li>Thundercat
          <li>XXXTENTACION
        </ul>
        There are too many more for me to keep going, but I think you get the idea.

      <h4>Instruments</h4>
      <p>
        I would love to learn as many instruments as possible. A dream of mine for when I have my
        own place is to be able to have an entire room filled with instruments, and at any given
        time be able to pick up an instrument and play it like a boss. I don't know what it is,
        but instruments are just so fascinating to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first musical instrument I learned to play was the violin. I started playing in fourth
        grade and continued playing until I graduated high school. I went to two competitions with
        my high school orchestra and won first place both times. While I was playing I didn't think
        it would be something that I missed (mostly because I did not like my music teacher), but
        after not playing in years I do miss it a lot. Missing the violin, however, led me to pick
        up the guitar. I am now currently learning it and am still very new to the guitar, but I
        hope to get better and better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned the piano when I was younger, but I stopped playing for a few years and I
        have now forgotten everything I had learned. I don't own a piano anymore, but I have a
        MIDI Keyboard that I connect to my computer and mess around with in FL Studio from time
        to time. FL Studio, for those unaware, is a music production software and I use it to
        make songs. Although I like to make my own songs, I have not released anything to the
        public. I make music for myself, but maybe one of these days I will share what I have.
